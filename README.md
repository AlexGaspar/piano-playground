## Some exercices to help you get started with piano (You need a digital piano with MIDI)

Currently it will train you with music sheet reading. It will render a note randomly, wait for input from your piano, if you played the correct note, another one will be rendered, otherwise, keep trying.

Internaly it uses socket.io so you can connect your piano to any pc, and then for example display the music sheet on a tablet.

See gif below :
* 1 : Random a note
* 2 : I played the wrong note
* 3 : I played the correct note
* 4 : A new one is render
